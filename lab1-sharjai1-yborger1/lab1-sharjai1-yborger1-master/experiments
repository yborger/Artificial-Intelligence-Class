How does your better heuristic improve on blocking (while maintaining
admissibility)?
It takes into account the minimum number of moves required for the blocking vehicles to move out of the way fully, instead of just the number of blocking vehicles. It maintains admissibility because the blocking cars have to be moved out of the way before reaching the goal so the minimum number of steps for them to be moved out of the way will not over-estimate the cost.

If you implemented the bonus heuristic, how does it improve on
Manhattan (while maintaining admissibility)?
We found an explanation for our heuristic here: https://medium.com/swlh/looking-into-k-puzzle-heuristics-6189318eaca2.
Essentially, the last move of the board has to be the last tiles in the last or second last rows moving out of the bottom right corner. Manhattan distance does not account for this when the last tile in the last row is not in the last column and the last tile in the second last row is not in the last row. Therefore, we can add this heuristic on top of the manhattan heuristic. Since we are adding it on top and it is a constant value of 2 depending on conditions, it will only increase the estimated moves as compared to manhattan. It will also only increase them sometimes. And since it's a rule that one of the two tiles has to pass through the bottom right corner, it will never overestimate. Therefore, admissibility is also maintained. It is interesting to note, however, that this heuristic can sometimes make the search expanded moves longer than manhattan and sometimes smaller.
